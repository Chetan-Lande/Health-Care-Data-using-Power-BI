By creating new columns from using the data of previous columns enhance our model , remove the unwanted columns that not used for our model.
By using DAX function calculates the new measures, that helps in statistical analysis of dataset.

By deploying various tools in Power BI , we can showcase the dataset . In various fields , by using this we can easily analysis the dataset , and make our insights of dataset.

Use Cards visualization for presenting Statistical data.

Use decomposition tree visualization for presenting patients of alcohol that affects in various health parameters and with age groups. Same use for presenting patients of smoking.

Use Slicers  visualization for differentiate between Rural/Urban , gender(Male/Female) and Admission type (Emergency/Out of patient) , that apply on our model analysis by that format.

Use graphs for showing the Groupwise  patients  and weekly patients range for each day .


Using the cards visualization technique, we can present key statistics in a straightforward manner:
We display the total number of male and female patients separately to understand the gender distribution in the dataset.
Additionally, we show the average duration of ICU stay for male and female patients, providing insights .
By comparing the average durations of stay for males and females, we can discern potential differences in recovery times or treatment needs between genders.

Using the decomposition tree visualization technique, we present the following insights:
We analyze diseases associated with alcohol habits, highlighting health issues related to alcohol consumption.
Similarly, we explore diseases correlated with smoking habits, highlighting health issues related to smoking.
By categorizing patients into age groups, we observe the distribution of diseases across different age groups , aiding in age-specific healthcare planning.
Furthermore, we examine the number of patients admitted each week, providing an overview of patient flow and hospital activity throughout the weeks.
By using Slicers technique we can differentiate between Rural/Urban , gender(Male/Female) and Admission type (Emergency/Out of patient).
